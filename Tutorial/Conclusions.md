# Alternatives to Google Flutter
There are some alternatives to Google Flutter such as Xamarin which is used for developing mobile and web applications.
Xamarin is in C#.
There's also React Native which can be used for developing native mobile apps as well as web apps. This is written in JavaScript.
It's also possible to make a web app and run it on mobile as well; however, it wouldn't have the native support.
